# Short Overview (for AzerothCore-Catalouge)

* Name:   can fly override PoC
* What it does: This module disallows flying in the Hellfire Peninsula to demonstrate the working of the CanFlyinZoneOverride Hook.

## How to use the POC-CanFlyinZoneOverride for Azerothcore
just put this in your modules directory.

##
How to test:
* go the Hellfire Peninsula and try to fly, it won't work. Go to any other place you normally can fly eg. Nagrand and you should be able to fly normally.
* remove the module and go to the Hellfire Peninsula - you should be able to fly again.
